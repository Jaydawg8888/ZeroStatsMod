# Negative Stats Mod for DarkViperAU

## Description

This mod for **Grand Theft Auto V** alters the skills of each story character (Michael, Franklin, & Trevor) in the stats menu, permanently setting them to their lowest possible values. This mod drastically limits or even disables the 'Special' ability for each character.

**Note:**
Whilst in the character switching menu, it will display their original skills. This is cosmetic. From testing  the prologue of the story mode up until Michael is unlocked, Franklin is rendered unable to use his special ability altogether.

p.s. Removing the mod **should** will revert the character's stats/skills to their default values.

## Installation Steps

1. Download and install [Script Hook V](http://www.dev-c.com/gtav/scripthookv/).
2. Download [Script Hook V Dot Net](https://github.com/scripthookvdotnet/scripthookvdotnet/releases) (Tested v3.6.0).
3. Once you have both of these navigate to your GTA V game directory.
4. Create a `Scripts` sub-directory if it doesn't already exist.
5. Drop the `NegativeStatsMod.dll` file into the `Scripts` directory.
